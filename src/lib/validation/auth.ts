/**
 * Client-side validation for the auth forms.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO VALIDATION LIBRARY HERE
 *
 * The repo has no zod, no react-hook-form, no yup. Adding one for two forms
 * costs bundle on a page whose whole point is to load fast, and buys type
 * inference we do not need for four fields. These are five small pure
 * functions.
 *
 * WHY THESE RULES ARE A MIRROR, NOT A SOURCE OF TRUTH
 *
 * The server re-validates every one of them in `password_service.validate_password`,
 * and the server's answer is the only one that matters — anyone can skip this
 * code entirely by POSTing directly. What client-side validation buys is
 * *latency*: telling someone their password is too short without a round trip,
 * and before they have submitted a password to the network at all.
 *
 * The consequence is that these rules must be kept in step with the Python
 * deliberately. They are duplicated, not shared, because the alternatives are
 * worse: shipping a rules endpoint adds a round trip to the thing we were
 * avoiding, and generating one from the other adds a build step for ~40 lines.
 * Any change to the policy in `password_service.py` must be repeated here.

 * addresses (plus-addressing, new TLDs, apostrophes) and there is no recourse
 * for the user when they do. The authoritative check is the verification email:
 * an address that cannot receive mail cannot complete signup, whatever it
