/**
 * Step data per problem, keyed by slug.
 *
 * Every number here was taken from the problem's own VISIBLE test cases, so what
 * the learner watches is the case they are about to run. See `types.ts` for why
 * the values are pre-computed strings rather than arithmetic done at render time.
 *
 * VISIBLE, AND THE WORD IS LOAD-BEARING. This file is `"use client"` all the way
 * down — it ships to every browser in the bundle. The API is careful about hidden
 * cases (`routers/problems.py` filters them out of the read path,
 * `execution.py:redact_for_response` strips them from grading responses, and both
 * call it a security boundary) and none of that reaches here. A hidden case's
 * expected output pasted into a caption is published, and the held-out grading
 * signal for that problem is gone.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: this file rendered `cross-entropy-loss`'s only hidden
 * expected output, to six decimals, in a caption about the 1e-12 clamp. The value
 * is deliberately not repeated here — a comment explaining the leak that quotes it
 * is still the leak. `tests/test_catalog_coverage.py` asserts the general rule.
